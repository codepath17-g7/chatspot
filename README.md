# Chatspot
 
**Chatspot** is an ad-hoc location based messaging app. It dynamically creates chatrooms when two or more users are in a certain geographic area. Users can also “visit” other chatspots around the globe by searching for areas on the mapview. It provides a quick and easy way for users to chat with others around them without requiring contact info.
 
## About
 
 The consensus amongst the four of us for what this app should be and how it should work came very naturally, because each of us had independently felt a need for a tool like this. Chatspot is a platform to help you connect to the people around you in a new and unobtrusive way. In our day-to-day, there are a lot of people around us who are busy, in their own heads, or just don’t want to be bothered or interrupted. The uncertainty of starting a possibly unwanted social interaction with a stranger deters many people from making them at all. There is no doubt many connections, friendships-to-be, or would-be communities are lost because of this phenomenon. For all the unfriendlies, there are an equal or greater number of people who would be happy to chat, share jokes, and make new friends. Chatspot is a platform for that to happen. Whether you just moved to a new town and want to make friends, want to chat with the folks around you at a coffee shop, or want to find others hiking Halfmoon Bay at sunset to exchange awesome photos, Chatspot simplifies creating communities on the fly.
